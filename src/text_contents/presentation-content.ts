    '1': 'CONTEXTUALIZATION',
    '1.1': 'In this first part, a brief exposition is presented regarding: (i) the behavior of the referred inflation indices during the comprised time span; and (ii) the range and limitations of the methodologies used for predictions.',
    '1.2': 'The referred indices exhibit relatively distinct behaviors. As mentioned in the Attachment part,  the IPCA series tracks price fluctuations only for retail consumers, thus it is generally smaller than IGP-M both in magnitude and volatility - given that IGP-M most relevantly measures wholesale price changes, and is more sensitive to several factors, such as exchange rates dynamics and  pressures on production-side costs, in general.',
    '1.3': 'In the analyzed series, three moments can be noticed where there seems to be a greater tendency towards extreme values: a general strike led by truck drivers that took place in may 2018; and both the start and the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic - which occurred in mid-2020 and at the beginning of 2021, respectively.',
    '1.3.2': 'Throughout 2021, the IPCA 12-month variation displayed notable volatility and exhibited an upward trend, surpassing the 10% level in the first half of 2022, but tending to diminish onwards.',
    '1.3.3': 'Regarding IGP-M, its 12-month variation peaked at the extreme value of 37,04% in May 2021, and has been falling  since then, entering in negative territory - which is also called deflation - with the - 4,47% value observed in May 2023. Graphs illustrating the 12-month variation for both indices can be found in Item 2 - Results Presentation. ',
    '1.4': 'An important point concerning the projections is that they were made with the use of techniques that only consider functions of  historical values of the indices for predictions, so it’s possible that they are not capturing recent trends related to influential factors affecting price behaviors  - for instance, the current expectations of future prices (BACEN, s. d.), for which there appears to be strong evidence of declining:',
    '1.4.2': 'IBAAAAGEN AQUI',
    '1.4.3': 'In Picture I, which is an excerpt from the Boletim Focus (BACEN, 2023) survey published on June 19th, 2023, it is shown that the medians for expectations on the variation of both IPCA and IGP-M throughout 2023 have been declining for five and ten weeks, respectively. Additionally, it can be observed that the median expectation of the 12-month variation of IGP-M fell below the negative threshold, reaching -1.21% in June 2023.',
    '1.4.4': 'Consequently, since the data used for predictions only extend until May 2023, the predicted values might not be capturing the new information available, and might be somewhat overestimating future inflation.',
