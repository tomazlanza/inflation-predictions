# Inflation predictions website

## Initial intent and app design choice

Studying project on Single-Page Applications and Client-Side Routing using React. 

Its initially loaded HTML is set to a minimum amount, with all of its content being further dynamically rendered as user-chosen states change.

## About its content

As detailed on the app About page, the content presented on the website consists in an evaluation of models of both of Brazil’s main inflation indexes. 

The entire report, with a still partial translation to English, along with the R scripts developed for the task, is available for download inside a zip file.

One can download the *inflation_predictions_files.zip* either directly from this repo or by running locally the application, as further explained, and by clicking on the “Download” button from the top menu.

## Run the page locally

On a CLI, execute the following commands:

* Clone this repo to your computer:

  ``` git clone https://github.com/tomazlanza/inflation-predictions ```

* Install its dependencies:

  ``` npm install ```

* Run locally the app through its Vite dev dependency:

  ``` npm run dev ```

* Access the app at the **localhost:5173** in a browser - as a default, but one should change the 5173 port reference accordingly to the one being used.
