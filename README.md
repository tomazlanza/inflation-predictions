# Inflation predictions website

## Initial intent and app design choice

This project has its initially-loaded HTML to a minimum amount, with all of its content being further dynamically rendered as user-chosen states change.

## About its content

As detailed on the application's About page, the content presented on the website consists in an evaluation of models of both of Brazil’s main inflation indexes. 

The entire report, with a still partial translation to English, along with the R scripts developed for the task, is available for download inside a zip file.

One can download the *inflation_predictions_files.zip* either directly from this repo or by running locally the application, as further explained, and by clicking on the “Download” button from the top menu.

## Instructions for running the page locally

* Create a new folder;

* Run the following code:

  ``` git clone https://github.com/tomazlanza/inflation-predictions ```
  
  ``` npm run dev ```
